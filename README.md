## 我们与平权

我们与平权是一个发起于2016年11月的草根项目，旨在赋权于中国女性与男性，使TA们可以自主选择自己的生活方式，婚恋方式与职业路径。微信公众号每周推送一篇原创文章，以社会性别视角分享个人经验、推荐影视作品与书籍、分享关于性别议题的观点。每两周举办一次线下活动对特定性别话题进行深入讨论，以期使更多人了解日常生活中的性别问题，并结成社群解决问题。

我们与平权”We and Equality" is a grass root project started in November 2016 dedicated on empowering Chinese women and men to choose their lifestyles regardless of gender. Through the WeChat Subscription account, we release original articles every week to raise awareness and knowledge of gender-related topics in China. The once-every-2-weeks offline activities help us create an environment for in-depth discussions on challenging gender issues, and slowly enlarge the community itself. The WeChat groups provide an online platform to support each other as a community. The products we design also deliver empowering messages while financially support the project as the single source.
